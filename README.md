Deeplearning.AI course 1 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning) Week 1

Linear regression implementation in Octave.

ex1.m - with one variable
ex1_multi.m - with multiple variables

Break-down of the code:
Compute cost for one variable -- computeCost.m 
Gradient descent for one variable -- gradientDescent.m

Feature normalization -- featureNormalize.m
Compute cost for multiple variables -- computeCostMulti.m 
Gradient descent for multiple variables -- gradientDescentMulti.m
